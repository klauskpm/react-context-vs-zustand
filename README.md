# React Contextual State Management Benchmark

## Explanations
- When I say **Contextual** it doesn't mean only `Context`, but other technologies that manage state in a contextual way, like `Zustand`, `Redux`, and others;
- The test at the moment is focusing only on `Context` and `Zustand`;
- We are testing the project in 4 ways:
  - Triggered render / full render;
  - Render time;
  - Project size;
  - DX (Developer Experience);

The app and tests are being built at the moment. So there is nothing to see at this point.

If you wish to see the old test results, please check the [old README](README-old.md).
There you will find instructions to see the old code, and see the results generated at the time.
